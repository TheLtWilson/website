My website and blog is based off the [astro-eurodite](https://github.com/jktrn/astro-erudite) theme built by [enscribe](https://enscribe.dev) with a couple of modifications made by yours truly. It also includes a comment system that relies upon GitHub Issues using [utterances](https://utteranc.es/).

I made this website so that I could share some of the logic and reasoning behind my projects, write guides for community events, and share some personal ongoings from my life.

And of course, this project is open source and available under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
