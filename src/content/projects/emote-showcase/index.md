Back in 2021, I wanted to make an extension for Twitch that would display all the emotes in a chatroom, even third-party ones. Which wasn't a new concept, but the whole appeal was that you could control the color scheme of the extension to match your brand and display emotes from 7TV, the newest contendor in third-party emote services.

The project lasted for almost 3 years, being archived and taken down from Twitch's extension market in March of 2024. But, during its lifetime it amassed a staggering **27,843 broadcasters** using the extension, and an eye-boggling **17.4 million unique users** that had interacted with the extension, only growing as time went on. Making it my most widely used projects to this day.

As my largest project to-date, I had my own frustrations with working on it and interacting with Twitch's team that approved extensions. Not to mention, I didn't really want to be responsible for a project that millions of people were using. I touched on this briefly in my [retiring RCWDEV post](/blog/2024/goodbye-rcwdev), if you want to read more about that.
