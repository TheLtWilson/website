My website and blog is based off the [astro-eurodite](https://github.com/jktrn/astro-erudite) theme built by [enscribe](https://enscribe.dev/) with a couple of modifications made by yours truly.

I made this website so that I could share some of the logic and reasoning behind my projects, write guides for community events, and share some personal ongoings from my life. Not to mention, as a landing spot for any future projects that I may want to work on.
