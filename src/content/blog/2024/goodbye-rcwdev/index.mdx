As of yesterday, March 18th of 2024, I have decided to stop using the name RCWDEV for good. Additionally, I have also stopped supporting and updating my Twitch extensions.

I made the decision to stop maintaining my Twitch extension, *Lt. Wilson's Emote Showcase*, after more than 2 years of updates to it. Given that it was the project of mine that became the most popular, amassing more than **27,000** installs and **17,000,000** unique users, why did I decide to quit maintaining it? Well the answer is pretty simple.

I was no longer interested in the project. Twitch has constantly been a pain in the rear-end by implementing halts on upcoming version reviews, or their lack of properly maintained documentation. And most importantly, my anxiety provides me with stress knowing that I am the sole maintainer of a project that more than 17 million people have used.

Going in to 2024, I had big plans for RCWDEV, and especially for Twitch extensions. I had this idea of making a custom dashboard to configure everything in, and providing a cheap subscription for big creators to help support the projects I was creating. For example, for the emote showcase, I had an idea where users who had a subscription could provide a custom image for various elements to customize their emote showcase to their liking, reorganizing the order in which emotes appeared, and other features that just wouldn't be feasible through Twitch's default configuration service.

## What about RCWDEV?

In all honesty, the ditching of the name has been on the back burner for quite some time. I always thought that it was weird that my extensions were published under and contained the name Lt. Wilson but when you look at the source code, it's from a different alias called RCWDEV - it just didn't make sense.

I created an organization inside of Twitch with the hopes of being able to transfer the extension from my personal account to the organization so that it would appear to be published under the RCWDEV name, but not only is that not possible, I fear that it would've just generated more confusion.

To add the cherry on top of the cake, most of the coding endeavors that I went through were for my own Twitch channel. Which is called [TheLtWilson](https://twitch.tv/theltwilson) - not RCWDEV. So there wasn't really a reason for me to be using the alias when the name I've been using almost everywhere else is Lt. Wilson.

That isn't to say I haven't been using the RCWDEV branding for longer, in fact I have almost certainly has the alias for quite a longer period of time. Initially I was developing things under the name "RileyDev." Fun fact, on the Lt. Wilson YouTube channel, one of my very first live streams was a stream working on a "RileyDev" project.

This name eventually changed to "RCW Development" and not too long after, to the name we are currently discussing. But the problem wasn't how long I've been using this alias, it was how little I utilized it. Across all social media, even the links in my own GitHub profile, were linked to either a personal account, or the other alias that I go under, Lt. Wilson.

## So, now what?

Like I said, I will no longer be using the name RCWDEV. If I have a new project I want to work on, it will either be under my personal name or under the name Lt. Wilson. And things should start to reflect that. For instance, my GitHub profile has already been renamed to [github.com/theltwilson](https://github.com/theltwilson). I intend to keep things this way to better reflect the things I'm up to, and to stop people from being confused on who I actually am.

Eventually, this blog will probably either disappear, or be moved to a different domain that better reflects the identity I want everyone to see.

So, with that being said. **Goodbye, RCWDEV.**
