This one is going to be a little bit difficult to write, as this one gets a little personal. So, fair warning, if you don't like reading about sensitive topics
like depression, I recommend you do not read this one. But if you don't care, here we are.

## Feeling lonely.

I don't think I've ever dicussed this publicly, but I have struggled with my emotions for a very long time. In all honesty, for as long as I can remember.
I have always found myself struggling to talk about subjects like love, grief, or anger. And by extension, I don't feel like I can be emotionally available for
friends or family. This has led to me losing a lot of the friendships I once had. Because of how poorly I handle emotions, I just took everything in stride and let it
bottle up inside, until I hit a breaking point.

In the past couple of months, I've had some of the most stressful and depressing months of my life. My cat, which I genuinely cherish as my first pet (*even though she's technically not...*)
was experiencing health issue after health issue. Fortunatley, she's doing better as of right now, but at the time there were some things going on, that had a serious possibility
of her life being at risk.
